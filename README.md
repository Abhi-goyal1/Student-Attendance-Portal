generate reports month wise, datewise.

# 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of preparing of this document is to provide detail information of
STUDENT ATTENDANCE PORTAL. This document describes the motive of
entiresystem that is including in our project, its user, interactions, and end
users. The requirements will be presented using textual descriptions to

taking attendance , and student can also monitor their attendance after the 
day, weakly and monthly.

# 2.2 Project Modules

This project is moving around 3 main modules Student , teacher , Admin. 
Student Module:
 Register and Login: Student first register to our website then he/shewill
eligible to use our services, take part in our processes.
 View Attendance : Student can view attendance .
 Teacher Module:

according to their requirements.
 View Attendance: Teacher can view attendance.
 Manage Students: Teacher can able to add and remove the 
students.

Administrator:

 Login: Admin login to get the status of processes that are running in
entire system of this project.
 Add: Admin can add new students and teachers.
 Remove: Admin can remove students and teacher also and restrict any 
person.
 Update: Admin can modify any account details, offers and schemes, any
details or information in web sites(even confidential information).

# 2.3 USER AND CHARACTERISTICS

There are three users interact with the system and their characteristics are 
asfollows:
 ADMINSTRATOR: administrator is responsible for the maintenance of
content over the web portal, he updates the current status and
administrator takes the feedback from the various users and utilizes it for
the betterment of services.
 STUDENTS: Customers are registered candidates and able to get the 
details of attendance other services that are provided by our system.
 TEACHER: Teacher is responsible for the maintenance of content over 
the web portal, he updates the current status .

# 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints

The team has selected PHP language to implement theCode Behind
functionality for web pages. The team will be using the VS code IDE to edit 
and create the web portal. The design constraint is that the computers at
each place may not follow similar screen resolutions. This can lead to the
web portal not having the impact it is planned to have.

# 2.5 User Documentation

 Software requirements specification document.
 Extensive online help will be available at all times when using the system.
This online help will guide the user, which may or may not be computer or
Internet knowledgeable, through each aspect of the system.

# 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

 It is assumed that the system will be able to interface with an email server
in order to send a status email to contacts of the system.It is assumed
that the system will interface with a MYSQL databas

# 3. SYSTEM FEATURES
# 3.1 Attendance Management

This feature of allow administrator and teacher to manage attendance 
over the web portal. He can add or delete new categories, new sub 
categories and new students. Priority of this feature is high, because the

# 4 EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIERMENT:
# 4.1 User Interfaces:

There will be two “separate” user interfaces the web portal. One will be
used by the administrator of the system to update and add content over
the web portal. The second user interface is simply a different web page.
The user interface for the system will be a web page on the Internet. A
prototype will be created that represents the final interface for the
system in terms of look and feel. The prototype can be accessed through
a web link provided soon. The user interface will be limited to the types
of controls that can be generated using HTML, JavaScript, and Cascading
Style Sheets. The user interface code will be generated by individual
developers.

# 4.2 Hardware Interfaces:

The Hardware Interfaces of the system are handled by the Windows
Server operating system. No hardware dependent code will be written by
the development team.

# 4.3 Software Interfaces:

 Operating System: The software is being designed to run on Windows
Server (version?). Windows Server (version?) includes the latest version
of Apache Tomcat7.2.1.
 Web Server: The software is being designed to run on Apache Tomcat
Server7.2.1.
 Database: The system will access the MYSQL database for providing the
backend support for various features of the system.
 Libraries: The software will be created using the jar files.
4.4 Communications Interfaces:
 Web Interface: The application will be accessed over the Internet. All
features will accessible through the web portal.
 Emails: The administrator can send status and answer emails to the
customers.

# 5 OTHER NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
# 5.1 Performance Requirements:

 Modem Connection: The users of this web page who have a 56Kbps
modem connection to the Internet should expect to be able to load any
page of within 10 to 20 seconds.
 Broadband Connection: The users of this web page who have a
broadband connection should be able to load every page within 2 to 5
seconds.
 Client Hardware: The performance of the system will also depend on
the client machine.

# 5.2 Safety Requirements:

There are some risks too that come with when admin add new project
then no any unauthorized builder can’t access details of the projects. And
only register builder access the our customer details.

# 5.3 Security Requirements:

SEC-1 – The system shall only allow authorized users to access the login,
lost password, and registration page.
SEC-2 – The system shall require a login and password to gain access to
the site.

# 5.4 Software Quality Attributes:

 Availability: The system must be available for use when it is needed
during the critical months of updating the system. The web portal should
have 99% uptime.

 Reliability: Data, as entered, must be correctly stored in the database.
In addition, the database should use transactions so that partial entries
are not stored in the database. Because the user of the system may be
inexperienced, each feature must work correctly 99% of the time. The
logic required is not complex enough to allow for a lower expectation.

 Usability: The system will be used by individuals of varying skill level
and technical competence. The system shall be intuitive to use and have
extensive online help documentation to walk users through the operations
they are trying to perform.

 Maintainability: The system will likely be developed by a different team
at the same time. The code and design need to be documented well
enough and designed such that a senior project team with the same
amount of academic and experience can ramp up on the project within 4
weeks.
